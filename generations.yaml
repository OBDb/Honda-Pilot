generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The original Honda Pilot was introduced as a midsize crossover SUV designed to provide minivan-like versatility with SUV styling and capability. Built on a modified Odyssey platform, it featured a boxy, upright design that maximized interior space. Powered by a 3.5L V6 engine producing 240 HP paired with a five-speed automatic transmission, it offered standard front-wheel drive or optional VTM-4 (Variable Torque Management 4-wheel drive) system. The interior provided seating for eight across three rows, with a relatively flat floor and good cargo flexibility. This generation established the Pilot as Honda's first three-row SUV and an important addition to the growing crossover segment, emphasizing practical family transportation over off-road capability."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Pilot maintained the boxy styling of its predecessor but with more rounded edges and an updated front fascia. Slightly larger than the first generation, it offered improved interior space and refinement. Powered by an enhanced 3.5L V6 producing 250 HP, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission, it introduced Variable Cylinder Management for improved fuel efficiency. The interior featured a more modern design with improved materials and technology, including an available rear entertainment system and navigation. The three-row, eight-passenger layout continued with enhanced flexibility and storage solutions. A refresh in 2012 updated the styling and features, while addressing criticisms of the original design. This generation built upon the Pilot's reputation as a practical, reliable family SUV with car-like handling and three-row versatility."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The third-generation Pilot featured significantly sleeker styling, abandoning the boxy shape of previous generations for a more aerodynamic profile. Built on a new platform shared with the Odyssey and Ridgeline, it offered improved driving dynamics and refinement. Powered by a revised 3.5L V6 producing 280 HP, paired with either a six-speed or nine-speed automatic transmission depending on trim level, it delivered improved performance and efficiency. The interior was completely redesigned with more premium materials, enhanced technology including an 8-inch touchscreen on higher trims, and available seven-passenger seating with second-row captain's chairs. Safety advanced with the available Honda Sensing suite of driver assistance features. A refresh in 2019 updated the styling and made Honda Sensing standard across all trims. This generation elevated the Pilot's position as a sophisticated three-row crossover with improved comfort and technology, competing effectively in the increasingly crowded midsize SUV segment."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Pilot features a complete redesign with more rugged, truck-like styling that contrasts with the sleeker previous generation. Slightly larger in nearly all dimensions, it offers improved passenger and cargo space. Built on a new light truck platform, it emphasizes capability with an available TrailSport trim featuring increased ground clearance, all-terrain tires, and skid plates for moderate off-road use. Powered by a new 3.5L V6 producing 285 HP paired exclusively with a 10-speed automatic transmission, it offers refinement with incrementally improved performance. The interior represents a major advancement with higher quality materials, a standard 7-inch digital instrument display (9-inch available), and either a 7-inch or 9-inch central touchscreen depending on trim. Available features include a panoramic moonroof, heated and ventilated front seats, and a removable second-row middle seat that can stow in the underfloor cargo area. Safety technology has been enhanced with the latest generation of Honda Sensing, including Traffic Jam Assist and Traffic Sign Recognition. This generation aims to balance family-friendly features with more adventurous styling and capability, positioning the Pilot as a versatile option in the highly competitive three-row midsize SUV segment."
